# Australia-Rain-Prediction
Developed a predictive model to forecast next-day rain in Australia based on 10 years of daily weather observations.
Conducted comprehensive data exploration, including visualization of relationships between weather features and rain occurrence.
Employed data cleaning techniques to handle missing values, dropping columns with significant missing data, and encoding categorical variables.
Utilized popular machine learning algorithms for classification:
Logistic Regression: Achieved an accuracy of 84.7% in rain prediction.
Decision Tree Classifier: Obtained an accuracy of 78.9%.
Random Forest Classifier: Improved accuracy to 85.5%.
XGBoost: Further enhanced accuracy to 85.6%.
Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Applied best practices in data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation to optimize predictive performance.
Demonstrated proficiency in Python programming, including libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.
Documented and communicated findings effectively through visualization and concise summaries.
Collaborated with team members to brainstorm ideas, share insights, and iterate on model improvements.
Actively engaged in continuous learning and exploration of new techniques to enhance predictive modeling skills.
